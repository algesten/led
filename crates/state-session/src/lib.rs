//! Session persistence state atom (M21).
//!
//! The session is the cross-process editor state that survives a
//! quit / restart cycle: which tabs were open, where each cursor
//! sat, what the active tab was. The actual SQLite I/O lives in
//! the session driver; this crate is the data shape the runtime
//! folds the driver's events into and re-projects on quit.
//!
//! Three pieces:
//!
//! - [`SessionState`] — the live atom on `Atoms.session`.
//! - [`SessionData`] — the serialisable session payload.
//!   Crosses the driver ABI in both directions (Save command +
//!   Restored event).
//! - [`SessionTab`] — one entry inside a `SessionData`, the
//!   per-buffer slice (path + cursor + scroll).

///
/// - `Init` outbound → `Restored` inbound flips `primary` to
///   the flock outcome and stamps `last_saved` with whatever
///   the DB held.
/// - `Save` outbound → `Saved` inbound sets `saved = true`.
/// - The Quit gate consults `(saved || !primary)` to decide
///   whether the loop can break.
